# Online-Retail---Clustering

Online retail is a transactional data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

The project aims to segment the Customers based on RFM(Recency, Frequency, Monetary) so that the company can target its customers efficiently.

Recency — How recently did the customer purchase? It means the number of days since a customer made the last purchase.
Frequency — How often do they purchase in a given period. So we can understand this value as for how often or how many a customer used the product of a company. The bigger the value is, the more engaged the customers are.
Monetary — How much do they spend? It is the total amount of money a customer spent in a given period. Therefore big spenders will be differentiated with other customers such as MVP or VIP.
